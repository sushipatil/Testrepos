Your program should handle exceptions gracefully. Define a Python program that takes two command lines, the input file path and the output file path. Ensure that the program checks if both arguments are provided and that the input file exists. Implement error handling to deal with scenarios such as missing input files, invalid file paths, or permission issues when writing to the output file. If an error occurs during the file processing, display a user-friendly error message and exit the program with a non-zero exit code.
